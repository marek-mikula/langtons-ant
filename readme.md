# Langton's ant

> Langton's ant is a two-dimensional universal
> Turing machine with a very simple set of rules
> but complex emergent behavior. It was
> invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on
> a square lattice of black and white cells
>. The universality of Langton's ant was proven
> in 2000. The idea has been generalized in
> several different ways, such as turmites which add more colors and more states.
>
> ## Rules
>
> Squares on a plane are colored variously
> either black or white. We arbitrarily
> identify one square as the "ant". The ant can
> travel in any of the four cardinal directions
> at each step it takes. The "ant" moves according to the rules below:
>
> 1. At a white square, turn 90° clockwise, flip
> the color of the square, move forward one unit
> 2. At a black square, turn 90° counter-clockwise
>, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
